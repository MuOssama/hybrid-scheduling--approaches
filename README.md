# hybrid-scheduling--approaches
demonstrates the hybrid approach on a 30-task heterogeneous workflow. WOA optimization improved upon HEFT by 7.2% in makespan, reassigning 37% of tasks to better exploit processor heterogeneity. This validates the effectiveness of combining fast heuristic initialization with metaheuristic refinement
